# Learn React

A archive that holds all the dumb project I did whilist learning react. Each folder is a project on it's own. Most of 'em would've been scaffolded by `create-react-app` CLI tool.

I hate configuring webpack (mainly because I don't know how to do that xD)

## Projects

### [Person List](https://react.alphaman.me/personlist/build)

A simple page that has a form where you can enter your name, location and age which makes it to display those in a neat unordered list. That's it. Simple as that.
